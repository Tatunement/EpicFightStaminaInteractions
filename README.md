# Epic Fight Stamina Interactions

This mod is a recreation of Noyji's Epic Fight Stamina Plus made with the intent of porting his code inside the MDK environment, reorganize the code in a more readable way, make it fully configurable and fix the server-client incompatibility.

I also removed the requirement of having the VC Glider mod for it to function properly with the intention of making a small addon in the form of a mod or datapack to reintroduce the former features.

## What the mod does?
The mod makes it so that when you perform an actions as: Attacking, Sprinting, Using a Bow/Crossbow, Blocking with a shield will consume Epic Fight's stamina in a Souls-like type of mechanic.

After stamina reaches 0, you will receive a potion effect that will completely stop your movement making you more vulnerable to attacks for a couple instants.

It also adds some buffs when resting (crouching) near campfires (Each campfire gives you different effects).

## Requirements

Minecraft Forge Mod Loader Version: 47.3.11

Epic Fight: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/epic-fight-mod

## Known bugs
- Each time you'll load a world, inventory will render the potion effect as if you had 0 stamina.
- When reaching 0 stamina the effect given you by no stamina will refresh until you get 1 stamina point back.
